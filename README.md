# Overview
* The Canvas Drawing App allows users to create a customizable drawing grid and draw by clicking and dragging their mouse over the grid cells. The app includes features to start a new canvas and clear the drawing, making it easy to experiment and create simple designs.

# Features
* Create Customizable Canvas: Users can specify the size of the canvas grid (from 1x1 to 100x100).
* Draw on Canvas: Hold down the mouse button and drag over grid cells to "paint" them black.
* Hover Effect: Grid cells temporarily turn black on hover but return to the default color if not clicked.
* Clear Canvas: Reset the canvas back to the initial state, with all cells cleared.
* Responsive: The app adjusts the size of the grid cells to fit within the container dynamically.
